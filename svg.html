        <p>The graph compares the electric range of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) over time. BEVs generally achieve higher ranges, especially after 2010, due to advancements in battery technology. They also show wider variation, with some models offering significantly higher ranges. PHEVs, which combine smaller batteries with combustion engines, exhibit more consistent but lower ranges. Both vehicle types see increased adoption and diversity after 2012, highlighting growing interest in electric mobility. The data reflects BEVsâ€™ rapid improvement in range, making them competitive with traditional vehicles, while PHEVs serve as a transitional technology for consumers.</p>
